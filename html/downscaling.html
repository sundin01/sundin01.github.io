            Reanalyses capture only the large-scale, but some variables vary strongly on much smaller scales.
            This small-scale variation depends on topography or land cover (e.g., near coast lines), for instance.
            Reanalysis data therefore often require spatial refinement. The same is true for weather forecasts,
            or for climate scenarios. The corresponding approaches are called “downscaling”.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Two classes of approaches are distinguished: numerical and statistical downscaling.
            The former requires a global model or reanalysis, into which a regional numerical weather prediction model
            is embedded. This nesting can be repeated to obtain local information. The regional model adds
            information on topography and land cover, while meteorological information is passed on from large to
            small scales. Weather forecasts are done in that way. Statistical downscaling uses statistical
            relations between the large-scale predictors (e.g., from a reanalysis) and local weather variables from observations.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            An intuitive statistical method is analog downscaling, which assumes that similar
            large-scale conditions lead to similar local weather. If a sufficiently large set of
            conditions is available for both, large-scale variables and local weather, then local weather can be estimated
            for a given large-scale situation by choosing the most similar case. You can train this approach in the exercise bellow.

        Assume we have unbiased climate model simulations of the future.
        They are good at projecting the large-scale circulation, such as depicted by the 500 hPa geopotential height fields,
        but not local precipitation, which strongly depends on the topography.
        Assuming that local precipitation will be similar for similar large-scale circulaiton
        and given a sufficiently large pool of potential analog days (with data for local precipitation as well as for large-scale predictions),
        we can determine the closest analog in the pool according to the similarity of the large-scale variables.
        A distance measure is needed for that (sound familiar? we already determined distances in the Particle Filter exercise).
        Here is a more detailed description of the <a href="data/Downscaling_Exercise.pdf" target="_blank">exercise</a>.

        In the attached sheet you get one year worth of data of local precipitation and three
        large-scale predictors; here's the <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">Excel version</a>.
        For R, please find two txt files (one with the <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Data_Pool.txt" target="_blank">pool of analogs</a>
        and one with the with the large-scale variables to be <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Data_Candidates.txt" target="_blank">downscaled</a>)
        an <a href="data/Analog_Exercise.R" target="_blank">R-script</a> to read it in.
        Now use the “Best Analog” approach based on the Eucledian distance (the variables are standardized).
        Note that this tasks requires you to calculate a distance matrix, which is a bit tricky in Excel.
        Here is a step-by-step <a href="data/Analog_Solution_StepByStep.pdf" target="_blank">solution</a>.
        Check your result against the solution in <a href="data/Applications_Analog_Solution.xls" target="_blank">Excel</a> or <a href="data/Analog_Solution.R" target="_blank">R</a>. The Excel solution also has the actual measurements.
        How good would you rate your reconstruction?
