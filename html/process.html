            From the raw instrument readings it is a long way to hazard maps.
            Observations in earlier times were sometimes made in units that are different from today’s.
            In addition, some of the raw measurements need to be processed in order to make them comparable.
            This is the case, for instance, for pressure when measured with a mercury barometer in the units of a length.
            Eventually we want to compare the atmospheric pressure at several stations (independent of their altitude, i.e.,
            reduced to mean sea level) in order to draw high and low pressure systems. To convert the length of the mercury
            column in the barometer in mm to mean sea-level pressure in hPa we need four steps: Adjustment to standard
            temperature, conversion to pressure units, correction for local gravity, and reduction to mean sea level.

        The attached <a href="data/ClimateData_Process_Exercise.xls" target="_blank">Excel file</a>
        gives the raw digitized pressure and temperature values for the station of St. Gallen, Switzerland,
        from 1813-1816, along with some auxiliary information. The observer adjusted the pressure to a temperature of
        10 °Réaumur (which was the standard at that time), but he did not do a gravity correction, and pressure is given in Paris inches.
        Convert the pressure readings to gravity-corrected station pressure (in hPa), temperature-adjusted to 0 °C (the present-day standard).
        If you want you can also reduce pressure to mean sea level (note that the World Meteorological
        Organisation recommends this only for stations below 750 m asl - this station is at 776 m asl).
        You can use Excel or R (here is the <a href="data/ClimateData_Process_Data.txt" target="_blank">txt file</a> with the data
        and an <a href="data/ClimateData_Process_Exercise.R" target="_blank">R-script</a> to read in the data and including the auxiliary information).
        Here is the solution for <a href="data/ClimateData_Process_Solution.xls" target="_blank">Excell</a> and for <a href="data/ClimateData_Process_Solution.R" target="_blank">R</a>.
