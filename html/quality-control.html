            Many errors may occur when doing measurements – or during the later processing.
            The instrument may not work well, the reading may be erroneous, there may by typos,
            or errors may occur during processing. Quality Control (QC) procedures are designed to find possible errors.
            A simple QC procedure is visual inspection. Plotting time series, their statistics, or scatter plots of correlated
            variables helps finding suspect values. In automatic tests, a first step often is to search for physically impossible values
            (e.g., negative precipitation, humidity >100%, temperature <0 K, pressure <0 hPa), a second step is to search physically
            unplausible values (e.g., temperatures outside -80 and +60 °C, pressure outside 500 to 1100 hPa).
            The third step may then make use of the full length of a series. For instance,
            values that exceed ±4 standard deviations are flagged for further inspection.
            A fourth step may be to analyse the sequence: Often temperature (pressure) observations
            on consecutive days that differ by more than 25 °C (40 hPa) are flagged, as are
            four or more equal consecutive values in a row. Further tests address the physical
            consistency between two variables and the spatial consistency by comparing neighbouring stations.

        Use your solution to the previous exercise and search for suspect temperature and
        pressure values using the four tests described above and by simple plotting.
        Do you find unplausible values? Here are possible solutions in
