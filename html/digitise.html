            Observations made prior to the era of electronic data acquisition are often not
            available electronically but only on paper. Sometimes not even their existence is known.
            Archive work is needed to find and document the data. Metadata – information on how and why
            the data were collected and by whom – is particularly important.
            Once the data are located in an archive and imaged, the work just begins.

            The first step is digitising the data. This is a tremendous effort – an effort of our society.
            Do you want to help in this endeavour?
