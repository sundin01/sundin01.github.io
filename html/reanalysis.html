            The climatology group of the Institute of Geography produced a palaeo-reanalysis, 
            a monthly, global, 3-dimensional reconstruction using the Ensemble Kalman Filter 
            in an offline assimilation approach. In contrast to online data assimilation, 
            in which the updated model state at every assimilation time step is used to initialize 
            a new forecast, offline data assimilation only performs the update. 
            This is possible because for atmospheric models, and over the time scale of the assimilation 
            (in this case six months), atmospheric initial conditions hardly matter. 
            The product is the "Modern Era Reanalysis"
            (ModE-RA, Valler et al. 2024 [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02733-8/" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02733-8</a>]), 
            which covers the period from 1421 to 2008. ModE-RA provides monthly output using a seasonal 
            assimilation window, such that monthly mean instrumental or documentary data can be assimilated 
            simultaneously with seasonal proxies (e.g. tree rings, plant or ice phenology). 
            The model prior or background xb is taken from an ensemble of 20 atmospheric model simulations (ModE-Sim). 
            In addition to ModE-RA, another data set termed ModE-RAclim is generated in which the prior is not taken 
            from the year to be reconstructed, but is a random sample of 100 model years. 
            This means that ModE-RAclim does not see the time-varying boundary conditions of the model
            (such as sea-surface temperatures or volcanic forcing) but only depends on the boundary conditions
            of the model and does not see the observations. Analyzing all three products together 
            (ModE-RA, ModE-RAclim and ModE-Sim) allows for disentangling where the information in ModE-RA comes from.

            Easy access to the data set is possible through the site: <a href="https://mode-ra.unibe.ch/climeapp//" target="_blank">https://mode-ra.unibe.ch/climeapp/</a>. 
            Here you can choose the data set to be analysed (ModE-RA, ModE-RAclim and ModE-Sim), 
            the variable, season and time period. It allows to display anomalies, composites, correlation and regression analyses.
